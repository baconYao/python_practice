# Python_practice

## This repo fulfills some examples about [Hello, Python I](https://www.manning.com/books/hello-python)

## Ch2

- Basic syntax practice 
- Do a simple game which is called 『Hunt the Wumpus』

## Ch3

- Use some standard libraries
    - os
    - sys
    - hashlib
- Do a file comparator
    - You can check...
        - Files have been changed or not
        - Files exist or not


## Ch4

- Build a todo list command line program
- Write **Unit Tests** to improve the quality of this program

How to use?
```bash
# Run test file
$ python test_todo.py

#Run main program
$ python todo.py

    #Commands
    show        # Show all the todo items
    new         # Add new item
    delete      # Delete item in todo list
    edit        # Edit the information of specific item
    quit        # Exit the program
```

Todo list will be save as todos.pickle when you quit the program automatically, and load list file when you execute the program.
